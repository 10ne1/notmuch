Pre-requisites
--------------

In addition to having notmuch, you need:

- gpg
- gnu tar
- gnu time
- xz. Some speedup can be gotten by installing "pixz", but this is
  probably only worthwhile if you are debugging the tests.

Getting set up to run tests:
----------------------------

First, you need to get the corpus.  If you don't already have the gpg
key for David Bremner, run

   % gpg --search 'david@tethera.net'

This should get you a key with fingerprint

    815B 6398 2A79 F8E7 C727  86C4 762B 57BB 7842 06AD

(the last 8 digits are printed as the "key id").

To fetch the actual corpus it should work to run

   % make download-corpus

In case that fails or is too slow, check

   http://notmuchmail.org/corpus

for a list of mirrors.

Running tests
-------------

The easiest way to run performance tests is to say "make perf-test", (or
simply run the notmuch-perf-test script). Either command will run all
available performance tests.

Alternately, you can run a specific subset of tests by simply invoking
one of the executable scripts in this directory, (such as ./basic).

Writing tests
-------------

Have a look at "basic" for an example.

add_email_corpus takes arguments "--small" and "--medium" for when you
want smaller subsets of the corpus to check.

time_done does the cleanup; comment it out or define "$debug" to leave
the temporary files around.

Currently there is no option processing (e.g. --debug) in the
performance tests.
