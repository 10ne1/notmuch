This file contains some more detailed information about building and
installing the documentation.

Building with sphinx.
---------------------

- You need sphinx at least version 1.0.

- You can build build and install man pages with 'make install-man'

- You can build man, info, html, and pdf versions of the docs
  (currently only the man pages) with

     'make install-{man|info|html|pdf}'

Building the man pages
----------------------

- You can build the man pages with rst2man (from python-docutils) with
  'make rst2man'.

- Currently there is no support to automagically install the resulting
  nroff files, but it should work to modify the target install-man
  in doc/Makefile.local.
