\"unread\" tag removed.

You can add or remove tags from the current message with '+' and

This buffer contains the results of a \"notmuch search\" of your
email archives. Each line in the buffer represents a single
thread giving a relative date for the thread and a subject.

Pressing RET on any line displays that thread. The '+' and '-'
keys can be used to add or remove tags from a thread. The 'a' key
is a convenience key for archiving a thread (removing the
\"inbox\" tag).

Other useful commands are `notmuch-search-filter' for filtering
the current search based on an additional query string,
`notmuch-search-filter-by-tag' for filtering to include only
messages with a given tag, and `notmuch-search' to execute a new,
global search.
