.TH NOTMUCH-REPLY 1 2011-12-04 "Notmuch 0.10.2"
.SH NAME
notmuch-reply \- Constructs a reply template for a set of messages.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B notmuch reply
.RI "[" options "...] <" search-term ">..."

.SH DESCRIPTION

Constructs a reply template for a set of messages.

To make replying to email easier,
.B notmuch reply
takes an existing set of messages and constructs a suitable mail
template. The Reply-to: header (if any, otherwise From:) is used for
the To: address. Unless
.BR \-\-reply-to=sender
is specified, values from the To: and Cc: headers are copied, but not
including any of the current user's email addresses (as configured in
primary_mail or other_email in the .notmuch\-config file) in the
recipient list.

It also builds a suitable new subject, including Re: at the front (if
not already present), and adding the message IDs of the messages being
replied to to the References list and setting the In\-Reply\-To: field
correctly.

Finally, the original contents of the emails are quoted by prefixing
each line with '> ' and included in the body.

The resulting message template is output to stdout.

.BR all " (default)"
Replies to all addresses.
.TP 4
.BR sender
Replies only to the sender. If replying to user's own message
(Reply-to: or From: header is one of the user's configured email
addresses), try To:, Cc:, and Bcc: headers in this order, and copy
values from the first that contains something other than only the
user's addresses.

See \fBnotmuch-search-terms\fR(7)
for details of the supported syntax for <search-terms>.

Note: It is most common to use
.B "notmuch reply"
with a search string matching a single message, (such as
id:<message-id>), but it can be useful to reply to several messages at
once. For example, when a series of patches are sent in a single
thread, replying to the entire thread allows for the reply to comment
on issue found in multiple patches.
