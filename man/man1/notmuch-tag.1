.SH NAME
notmuch-tag \- Add/remove tags for all messages matching the search terms.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B notmuch tag
.RI  "+<" tag> "|\-<" tag "> [...] [\-\-] <" search-term ">..."

.SH DESCRIPTION

Add/remove tags for all messages matching the search terms.

Tags prefixed by '+' are added while those prefixed by '\-' are
removed. For each message, tag removal is performed before tag
addition.

The beginning of <search-terms> is recognized by the first
argument that begins with neither '+' nor '\-'. Support for
an initial search term beginning with '+' or '\-' is provided
by allowing the user to specify a "\-\-" argument to separate
the tags from the search terms.

See the
.B "SEARCH SYNTAX"
section below for details of the supported syntax for <search-terms>.
