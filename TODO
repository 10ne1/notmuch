Emacs interface (notmuch.el)
----------------------------

notmuch command-line tool
-------------------------
Give "notmuch restore" some progress indicator. Until we get the
Xapian bugs fixed that are making this operation slow, we really need
to let the user know that things are still moving.

Fix notmuch.c to call add_timestamp/get_timestamp with path names
relative to the database path. (Otherwise, moving the database to a
new directory will result in notmuch creating new timestamp documents
and leaving stale ones behind.)

Fix notmuch.c to use a DIR prefix for directory timestamps, (the idea
being that it can then add other non-directory timestamps such as for
noting how far back in the past mail has been indexed, and whether it
needs to re-tag messages based on a theoretical "auto-tags"
configuration file).

Make "notmuch new" notice when a mail directory has gone more than a
month without receiving new mail and use that to trigger the printing
of the note that the user might want to mark the directory read-only.

Also make "notmuch new" optionally able to just mark those month-old
directories read-only on its own. (Could conflict with low-volume
lists such as announce lists if they are setup to deliver to their own
maildirs.)

notmuch library
---------------
Actually compile and install a libnotmuch shared library.

Fix to use the *last* Message-ID header if multiple such headers are
encountered, (I noticed this is one thing that kept me from seeing the
same message-ID values as sup).

Add support for the user to specify custom headers to be indexed.

Add support for automatic tagging of new messages based on particular
search criteria, (likely using an InMemory database for the new
messages).

General
-------
Audit everything for dealing with out-of-memory (and drop xutil.c).

Write a test suite.

Achieve 100% test coverage with the test suite.

Investigate why the notmuch database is slightly larger than the sup
database for the same corpus of email.
