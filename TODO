Add support to format a reply buffer for a particular message.

Selectively hide headers and bodies in notmuch-show mode in
notmuch.el, (for example, for read messages).

Compile and install a libnotmuch library.

Make "notmuch setup" not index all messages, but only what it can do
in a reasonable amount of time, (then add "notmuch index" so the user
can complete the job when convenient).

Fix to use the *last* Message-ID header if multiple such headers are
encountered, (I noticed this is one thing that kept me from seeing the
same message-ID values as sup).

Add support for the user to specify custom headers to be indexed.

Add support for automatic tagging of new messages based on particular
search criteria, (likely using an InMemory database for the new
messages).

Fix notmuch.c to call add_timestamp/get_timestampt with path names
relative to the database path. (Otherwise, moving the database to a
new directory will result in notmuch creating new timestamp documents
and leaving stale ones behind.)

Fix notmuch.c to use a DIR prefix for directory timestamps, (the idea
being that it can then add other non-directory timestamps such as for
noting how far back in the past mail has been indexed, and whether it
needs to re-tag messages based on a theoretical "auto-tags"
configuration file).

Audit everything for dealing with out-of-memory (and drop xutil.c).

Write a test suite.

Achieve 100% test coverage with the test suite.
