Welcome to Notmuch, a system for indexing, searching and tagging your email.

We hope that the process of building and installing notmuch is quick
and smooth so that you can soon be reading and processing your email
more efficiently than ever.

If anything goes wrong in the configure process, you can override any
decisions it makes by manually editing the Makefile.config file that
it creates. Also please do as much as you can to figure out what could
be different on your machine compared to those of the notmuch
developers. Then, please email those details to the Notmuch list
(notmuch@notmuchmail.org) so that we can hopefully make future
versions of notmuch easier for you to use.

We'll now investigate your system to verify that all required
dependencies are available:

if xapian-config --version > /dev/null 2>&1; then

    have_xapian=0

    cat <<EOF

*** Error: The dependencies of notmuch could not be satisfied. You will
need to install the following packages before being able to compile
notmuch:

EOF
    if [ $have_xapian -eq 0 ]; then
	echo "	Xapian library (including development files such as headers)"
	echo "	http://xapian.org/"
    fi
    if [ $have_gmime -eq 0 ]; then
	echo "	GMime 2.4 library (including development files such as headers)"
	echo "	http://spruce.sourceforge.net/gmime/"
    fi
    if [ $have_talloc -eq 0 ]; then
	echo "	The talloc library (including development files such as headers)"
	echo "	http://talloc.samba.org/"
    fi
    cat <<EOF

On a modern, package-based operating system such as Debian, you can
install all of the dependencies with the following simple command
line:

	sudo apt-get install libxapian-dev libgmime-2.4-dev libtalloc-dev

On other systems, a similar command can be used, but the details of the 
package names may be different, (such as "devel" in place of "dev").

EOF
    if [ $have_pkg_config -eq 0 ]; then
cat <<EOF
Note: the pkg-config program is not available. Both this configure
script and the Makefile of notmuch use pkg-config to find the
compilation flags required to link against the various libraries
needed by notmuch. It's possible you simply need to install pkg-config
with a command such as:

	sudo apt-get install pkg-config

But if pkg-config is not available for your system, then you will need
to manually edit the notmuch Makefile to set the variables such as
CFLAGS and LDFLAGS to the correct values without calling pkg-config.

EOF
    fi
cat <<EOF
When you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can run
configure again to ensure the packages can be found, or simply run
"make" to compile notmuch.

EOF
    exit 1
fi

printf "Checking for getline... "
if ! gcc -o getlinetest getlinetest.c > /dev/null 2>&1
then
    printf "No.\n"

else
    printf "Yes.\n"
    have_getline=1
fi
rm -f getlinetest

cat <<EOF

All required packages were found. You may now run the following
commands to compile and install notmuch:

	make
	sudo make install
